# Jamalang Tests

Jamalang contains a test suite that can be used to verify that a transpiler is
compliant with the specification. The test suite is located in the `TBD`
directory. Each test file has an accompanying `.out` file that contains the
expected output of the test.

The tests have to be transpiled into JS, then run by a test runner. Their
outputs can then be compared with the `.out` files that accompany them.
