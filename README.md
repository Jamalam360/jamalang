# Modifier

_Modifier_ is a domain-specific langauge for creating simple Minecraft modifications in an
easy-to-understand custom made language similar to Python in syntax, designed to be as easy to learn
as Python for complete beginners.

This repository contains both the implementation of the _Modifier_ language, as well as a Minecraft
mod to use it within the context of the game. While the language is abstracted from the game, as of
now it is not available for use outside of the mod. This may change in the future.
